# Create a Recipe App

### How the app works
This project obtains data (e.g., id, meal name, category, instructions, tags, ingredients) from an API and primarily uses JavaScript to section each piece of data into its respective place on the page. When the page loads, a random recipe is displayed with a title, picture, instructions, ingredient list, and other details. The user will find hyperlinks to the recipe's source and YouTube tutorial, as well as a button to generate a new random recipe.

The challenge for this project was practicing getting specific properties within the API's data. It also taught me to write cleaner code by avoiding functions within a function. Instead, the final result was to separate them into individual functions and call them (and pass information for some) when needed to render or re-render.

### Project Goals
Be able to integrate data from the ["TheMealDB"](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php) API's random recipe endpoint

### Technologies used
JavaScript, HTML, CSS, APIs
